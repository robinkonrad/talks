# Public speaking
Hi all, if you're visiting this repository you might have attended one of my [sessions](https://sessionize.com/robin-konrad), either online or in real life.

You will find my slide decks, code examples, demos and additional curated information & resources around the subject within this repo.

## How to come around
The resources belonging to each talk are stored by name in a dedicated folder. Each folder contains its own README for further instructions.
